Description:
    Deadwood is an anomaly detection algorithm based on Mutual Reachability
    Minimum Spanning Trees.  It trims protruding tree segments and marks small
    debris as outliers.  More precisely, the use of a mutual reachability
    distance pulls peripheral points farther away from each other.  Tree edges
    with weights beyond the detected elbow point are removed.  All the resulting
    connected components whose sizes are smaller than a given threshold are
    deemed anomalous.  The 'Python' version of 'deadwood' is available via
    'PyPI'.
